# To get access for Twitter, go to
# https://apps.twitter.com//
# and create a new app

# The consumer_key is the API key
twitter.consumer_key: UNSPECIFIED SECRET
twitter.consumer_secret: UNSPECIFIED SECRET
# then click on create access token, and put this here (in the local.yaml file, of course)

# You can debug this by ssh to the vagrant box, and then run this on the command line:
# hiera twitter.consumer_key
# it should list your new key, and not UNSPECIFIED SECRET
